#experiment 1:
can a meshed reconstruction actually be better than a point cloud reconstruction?

suspection:
-it should be more precise because outliers are filter
-it should definitelly have a better recall, because missing areas in the point cloud are interpolated.

results:
-tried with Ignatius where an out-of-the-box colmap reconstruction already gets this:
Point cloud:
distance tau : 0.010
precision : 0.9191
recall : 0.9881
f-score : 0.9524

98% recall does not allow for much room to improve.
Especially because even the LiDAR ground truth also has occlusion areas, which makes it irrelevant if the mesh is more complete there.

#update experiment 1:
indeed I could get the precision with my own Delaunay, where the points are even downsampled to --adt 0.02 (of course still much more than in the colmap Delaunay of the result below):

adt 0.02 Delaunay sampled:
distance tau : 0.010
precision : 0.8065
recall : 0.9895
f-score : 0.8886

However, the precision does go down.

If I in turn take only the points of the mesh (so not sample the facets) precision goes up!:



#experiment 2:
can a delaunay meshed reconstruction be better than a poisson meshed reconstruction?

results:

colmap Delaunay sampled:
distance tau : 0.010
precision : 0.8599
recall : 0.8901
f-score : 0.8747

Poisson:
distance tau : 0.010
precision : 0.8695
recall : 0.8550
f-score : 0.8622

Poisson actually has higher precision. Delaunay higher recall.


Conclusion:
-same experiments need to be done with more difficult scene again!


Hi, and thanks for the great dataset.

I noticed that in some scenes of the training dataset there is a significant amount of self occlusion in the LiDAR ground truth (e.g. the chest in Ignatius, or the load floor on the truck. Some of these areas are however visible in (potentially overlapping) images. If I understand the evaluation procedure correctly, if points are reconstructed in these areas, it will drive down the F-Score.

Additionally, I noticed that in the Truck scene, there are some sort of fairy lights above the truck that are also not present in the ground truth. Since the bounding volume for clipping is only 2D (a polygon), this area is still evaluated in the reconstruction.

Are my assumptions correct and do these problems also occur in the test datasets (where we do not have the ground truth)?
